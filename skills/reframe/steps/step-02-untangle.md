# Step 2: 🪢 Untangle

## STEP GOAL

Pull the threads apart — name each sub-problem before you try to solve anything. People bring you a tangled ball. If you try to diagnose the tangle, you'll pick the wrong thread every time.

**Interaction mode: INTERACTIVE**

## WHY THIS MATTERS

> Our first duty is to understand the problem. Having understood the problem as a whole, we go into detail. We separate its various parts, and we consider each part by itself.

> The difference between a good thinker and a poor thinker often lies in the ability to focus.

> If a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly, System 1 will find a related question that is easier and will answer it.

Your job: split the mess into clean, nameable pieces — then pick which piece to work on first.

## THE FLOW

One smooth conversation. 3 moves.

---

### Move 1: Name the Threads

Take everything from Surface and split it into 2-4 distinct sub-problems. Give each one a short, plain name.

**DISPLAY:**

"So from everything you've told me, I'm picking up a few separate things tangled together. Let me pull them apart:

1. **[Thread name]** — [one sentence]
2. **[Thread name]** — [one sentence]
3. **[Thread name]** — [one sentence]

Does that look right? Did I miss one? Did I split something wrong?"

→ **If they say "yes"** → move to Move 2
→ **If they add a thread** → add it and re-list
→ **If they merge two** → good — fewer threads is better. Re-list.

**Cap at 4 threads max.** If you see more, group them. Too many particulars are a burden on the mind.

---

### Move 2: Check for the Fake Problem

For the thread that looks most important, ask one question:

"I want to make sure we're looking at the right thing. Is **[thread name]** the real problem here? Or is it a stand-in for something deeper?"

This catches the substitution trap — the brain silently swaps the hard problem for an easy one.

Think about it like this: the cold weather is not really the problem — people's perception of the cold weather is the problem. That we can change.

→ **If they say "yes, that's the real one"** → move to Move 3
→ **If they reframe it** → great, you just found the real problem. Update the thread name.
→ **If they're not sure** → try: "What would change if [thread name] disappeared tomorrow? Would the situation actually be fixed?"

---

### Move 3: Pick the Starting Thread

Don't try to solve everything at once. Pick ONE thread to focus on first.

"Which of these feels like it's weighing on you the most right now?"

Or if one thread clearly blocks the others:

"**[Thread name]** looks like it's blocking everything else. Want to start there?"

→ **Once they pick a thread** → that's the input for Step 3 (Diagnose). Complete the step.

---

## COMPLETION CHECKLIST

**After EVERY user response, mentally check this list:**

- [ ] ✅ Problem split into 2-4 **named** threads
- [ ] ✅ User confirmed the threads look right
- [ ] ✅ Substitution check done on main thread
- [ ] ✅ ONE thread picked as starting focus

### TRIGGER LOGIC (Follow this EXACTLY)

```
AFTER EVERY USER RESPONSE:
  1. Count how many checklist items are satisfied
  2. Count current exchange number

  IF all 4 items satisfied
    → COMPLETE THE STEP NOW. Do not ask another question.

  IF exchange >= 9
    → SOFT CHECKPOINT (summarize threads, offer choice)

  IF exchange >= 12
    → HARD EXIT. Pick the most obvious thread. Complete the step.

  OTHERWISE
    → Execute the next move in sequence
```

---

## DEPTH AWARENESS

- **Exchanges 1-8:** Work through the 3 moves naturally.
- **Exchanges 9-10:** Soft checkpoint. Summarize threads identified, offer choice to continue refining or proceed.
- **Exchange 12+:** Hard exit. Pick the most blocked thread as focus, complete the step. Non-negotiable.

**At hard exit with missing checklist items:**
- If threads not confirmed: present your best split and say "I'm going with this breakdown."
- If no thread picked: pick the one that blocks the most others.
- Do NOT ask more questions. Decide and move.

---

## STEP COMPLETION

When the checklist is satisfied (or hard exit is reached):

**DISPLAY:**

"Okay, here's what we've got:

1. **[Thread name]** — [one sentence]
2. **[Thread name]** — [one sentence]
3. **[Thread name]** — [one sentence]

**Starting focus:** [picked thread]

I'm going to take a closer look at **[picked thread]** now. My turn to do some thinking.

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓ READY TO CONTINUE                                    │
│                                                         │
│  → Type `next` to proceed to Diagnose                   │
│  → Or share anything else you'd like me to know         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘"

**THEN STOP COMPLETELY. Do not continue. Do not start diagnosing. Wait for the user to type `next`, then read the next step file.**

## STEERING RULES

| If the user... | Then... |
|----------------|---------|
| Wants to skip straight to solving | STOP. Say: "I hear you, you want to move. Which part are we solving though? There are [n] things tangled here. Let's just name them, 30 seconds, then we pick one and go." |
| Keeps adding more threads | CAP IT. Say: "We've got a lot going on. Which 2-3 matter most to you right now? We can always come back to the rest." |
| Already knows which thread matters | GREAT. Skip to Move 3. But still do Move 2 (fake problem check) on their choice. |
| Can't separate the threads | HELP. Say: "That's okay, let me try. I think I hear [A] and [B] as separate things. Are they? Or are they the same problem?" |
| Goes back to venting (Surface stuff) | REDIRECT. Say: "I hear you, and that's all noted. Of the threads we named, which one feels like the real blocker?" |
| Reframes the problem deeper | CELEBRATE. Say: "Oh that's a much better way to look at it. Let me update the threads." Then re-list. |

---

## DO NOT

- Solve yet — you're separating, not fixing
- Split into too many threads — more than 4 overwhelms. Group related things.
- Accept the first framing — the obvious problem is usually the easy substitute, not the real one
- Skip writing them down — threads in your head get tangled again
- Let the user jump to a solution — if they say "I already know the answer," that's substitution. Slow down.
- Continue past exchange 12
- Ask another question when the checklist is already complete
