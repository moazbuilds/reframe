# Step 1: 👂 Surface

## STEP GOAL

Get the real story — facts and feelings — before anyone's brain runs away with a fake version. People don't describe problems. They tell you the story their brain already made up.

**Interaction mode: INTERACTIVE**

## WHY THIS MATTERS

> People's fast brain constructs the best possible story from whatever info it has — but it cannot allow for information it does not have.

> It is foolish to answer a question that you do not understand.

> If emotions are not permitted as inputs, they will lurk in the background and affect all thinking in a hidden way.

Your job: slow them down, get the raw truth, catch the hidden feelings.

## THE FLOW

One smooth conversation. 3 moves. Execute them in order.

---

### Move 1: Open and Listen

Open with warmth and let them talk:

**DISPLAY:**

"I'm glad you're here. Take a breath, and whenever you're ready, **tell me what's been going on.** What's the situation, what are you trying to do, and why does it matter to you right now?

I'm listening, take your time."

**THEN STOP.** Don't interrupt. Let them empty their head.

**While they talk, mentally note:**
- What sounds like a **fact** vs what sounds like an **opinion**
- What **emotion** is leaking through (frustrated? scared? angry?)
- What's **missing** — what didn't they mention?

---

### Move 2: Mirror Back Clean

After they share, play back what you heard — organized into 3 buckets:

"Okay, let me make sure I'm hearing you right. You **want** [goal]. Right now the situation is [facts only]. And the thing standing in your way is [blocker]. Did I get that right?"

This does 3 things at once:
- Extracts the 3 essentials (goal / data / condition) without interrogating them
- Strips opinions out by only mirroring facts
- Lets the user correct you if you got it wrong

→ **If they say "yes"** → move to Move 3
→ **If they correct you** → update and mirror again
→ **If something is vague** (they said "everyone hates it") → ask: "When you say that — what did you actually see happen?"

---

### Move 3: Read the Feeling and Dig Deeper

By this point you've heard enough to sense what they're feeling. Don't ask them to label it. You can already tell. Name it naturally as part of your response.

**Read the emotion.** Weave it into what you say, don't make it a separate question:
- "I can tell this has been really frustrating for you."
- "It sounds like this one's been sitting heavy."
- "I get the sense there's a lot of pressure around this."
- "This sounds exhausting, honestly."

**Then ask ONE natural follow-up** about the part of their story that feels thin, vague, or assumed. Don't ask a meta-question like "what don't you know?" Instead, dig into what's actually unclear.

Examples with a divorce scenario ("I'm going to divorce my wife, we've been fighting for years"):
- "You mentioned the fighting has been going on for years. Have you two tried anything to work through it, or does it feel past that point?"
- "When you say she doesn't respect you, what does that look like day to day?"
- "Is there something specific that happened recently that made this feel final?"

The blind spots reveal themselves through good follow-up questions, not by asking "what's your blind spot?"

→ **If they open up more** → note it for Diagnose
→ **If they stay surface** → try one more angle on what felt vague
→ **If they say "no, I've got it all figured out"** → gently: "What would someone who disagrees with you say?"

## COMPLETION CHECKLIST

**After EVERY user response, mentally check this list:**

- [ ] ✅ User said what they **want** (the goal)
- [ ] ✅ User said what they **have** (the facts, clean)
- [ ] ✅ User said what's **blocking** them (the constraint)
- [ ] ✅ Facts are separated from opinions
- [ ] ✅ Feelings are acknowledged (read and named, not asked)
- [ ] ✅ Blind spots explored through natural follow-up questions

### TRIGGER LOGIC (Follow this EXACTLY)

```
AFTER EVERY USER RESPONSE:
  1. Count how many checklist items are satisfied
  2. Count current exchange number

  IF all 6 items satisfied
    → COMPLETE THE STEP NOW. Do not ask another question.

  IF exchange >= 9 AND at least 4 items satisfied
    → SOFT CHECKPOINT (summarize, offer choice)

  IF exchange >= 12
    → HARD EXIT. Fill gaps with inference. Complete the step.

  OTHERWISE
    → Ask ONE question targeting the most important missing item
```

**CRITICAL:** When the checklist is fully satisfied, you MUST move to step completion IMMEDIATELY. Do not ask "is there anything else?" Do not keep exploring. The checklist being complete IS the trigger to stop.

---

## DEPTH AWARENESS

- **Exchanges 1-8:** Full exploration. Work through the 3 moves naturally.
- **Exchanges 9-10:** Soft checkpoint. Summarize ALL insights, offer choice to continue or proceed.
- **Exchange 12+:** Hard exit. One last question, then force step completion. Non-negotiable.

**At hard exit with missing checklist items:**
- Fill gaps with your best inference from what the user already shared
- Flag the inference: "I'm assuming [X] based on what you said about [Y]."
- Do NOT ask more questions. Use what you have.

---

## STEP COMPLETION

When the checklist is satisfied (or hard exit is reached):

**DISPLAY:**

"I really appreciate you sharing all of this. Here's what I'm hearing:

**You want:** [goal]
**The situation:** [facts, clean]
**What's in the way:** [blocker]
**How it feels:** [emotion]
**What's unclear:** [blind spots or assumptions uncovered]

Does that capture it?

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✓ READY TO CONTINUE                                    │
│                                                         │
│  → Type `next` to proceed to Untangle                   │
│  → Or share anything else you'd like me to know         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘"

**THEN STOP COMPLETELY. Do not continue. Do not start untangling. Wait for the user to type `next`, then read the next step file.**

## STEERING RULES

| If the user... | Then... |
|----------------|---------|
| Wants to skip to solutions | STOP. Say: "I totally get it, you want to move. But I promise this will be worth it. 3 quick questions and then we fly." |
| Gives opinions as facts | SEPARATE. Say: "You mentioned 'the team is unmotivated.' Help me understand, what did you actually see? What behaviors?" |
| Doesn't show any emotion | READ IT ANYWAY. There's always a feeling underneath. Name what you sense: "I get the feeling this is more stressful than you're letting on." |
| Is super confident super early | PROBE. Dig into the part that feels too clean: "You sound really sure about [X]. Walk me through how you got there." |
| Dumps a wall of text | MIRROR. Say: "I want to make sure I caught everything. I heard: [A], [B], [C]. Right?" |
| Gives vague answers | GO SPECIFIC. Say: "When you say 'things aren't working', can you give me one concrete example from this week?" |

## DO NOT

- Diagnose yet — you're gathering, not solving
- Ask leading questions — you'll fish for the answer you already suspect
- Trust "always/never/everyone" — these words hide opinions inside facts
- Skip feelings — they'll hijack every step after this
- Trust early confidence — less info = more confidence, it's a brain bug
- Give specific advice yet — start general, only go specific if stuck
- Ask multiple questions at once
- Continue past exchange 12
- Ask "anything else?" when the checklist is already complete
